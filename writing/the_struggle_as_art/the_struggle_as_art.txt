There are two conflicting views in game design. There’s the view that play is freedom and that games should allow you to experience it how you want to explore them; like a sandbox. Alternative to that view, there’s a new rising view that games provide us with alternate agencies. C Thi Nguyen, in his analytical philosophy book, Games: Agency As Art, suggests that instead of game designers providing us a sandbox to play with, they should design who we are in the world and decide which objectives we should care about. Looking at games with this framework allows us to explore even further what we love so much about them. 
By accepting being in a different reality with alternate objectives as to what we seek in real life, we are effectively allowing our existence to not be stuck as an object in the world but somethibg that is able to transcend our made up character.
(Expand on the idea before reaching this paraphrase)

To summarize his words, the fact that we love games so much means that we love to have fluidity of our agencies and allow ourselves to explore alternative realities.

He describes two types of conflicting game styles, achievement playing vs striving play. Achievement players will put the ends above the means. This is the type of game style you want to avoid as these are sore losers or people that t would continue to play the game without enjoying just to get a reward. The other play style, is striving play which means that you care about the struggle itself.This is where the aesthetics of the game will really unravel. By having the medium be the doing and not the expectating the player in itself creates the beauty with the guide of the game designer. Take for example a game a From Software game. The failure and the struggle is what gives the player this experience and emotional turnvoil that couldn’t be achieve through another medium. 

C Thi Nguyen has this saying that really resonates with me and highlights how we’ve been having the wrong conversation this whole time : “I’m not worried about games making serial killers i’m worried about it making wall street bankers”. In our current economical system we are only presented


If we emphasize a style of play that focuses on the struggle(Labor) we are effectively turning the pyramid of power by not prioritizing the outcomes, in the same way that we do in real life. 

Beauty is not having the biggest house in the neighborhood, but rather it is the actions that you take and the labor that you make. This doesn’t mean that we must focus on any kind of labor, but rather beautiful labor, that is labor that uplifts a community, that seeks to help out others and that seeks to make the world a better place. A kind of labor that brings purpose to our existence and it is as inclusive of others as it can be. This also puts into importance the process of failing. Failing which is seen as an intrinsically a bad thing can be beautiful in its own way and can be enjoyable without it being feared. 

Video game critics by the fault of the medium being so new tend to put too much focus on the cinematic beauty of a game, the emotional story telling, the imagery, the dialogue, but tend to miss out that these things are only valuable if they make the struggle (game loop) more beautiful/enjoyable. In the same way that living in a nice city might make improve our lives but work would still make it feel miserable, graphics will only improve the game if the game is actually enjoyable and screams to show it’s beauty where it matters.
